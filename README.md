### Example of Running via Command Line (cmd):

1. Open the "Start" menu and search for "Command Prompt" or "cmd".

2. Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator".

3. In the opened window, navigate to the folder containing the program, for example:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\Username\Documents\Blum-bot
   ```

4. Run the program with the specified number of games (e.g., 5) using the `-play` flag:
   ```
   blum_bot.exe -play 5
   ```

   Where:
   - `blum_bot.exe` is the name of the program's executable file.
   - `-play 5` is the flag indicating the number of games (in this case, 5).

5. Wait for the startup message and follow the instructions in the console.

### Important Notes:
- If you encounter an error stating that administrator privileges are required, close the program and repeat steps 1â€“4, ensuring that the command prompt (`cmd`) is running with administrator rights.
